# Sort Colors

## Problem
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

### Example:

    Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
    Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

## Solutions:

### Solution I: Keep three indices
Similar to **_Quick Sort_**, three indices are stored and updated to record the end of each segments.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        i, j = -1, -1
        
        for k, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num == 1:
                nums[k], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[k]
                j += 1
            elif num == 0:
                nums[k], nums[i+1] = nums[i+1], nums[k]
                if i != j:
                    nums[k], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[k]
                i += 1
                j += 1
                
        return nums
```
